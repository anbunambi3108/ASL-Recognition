# ASL-Recognition

- This project develops a machine learning system to recognize American Sign Language (ASL) gestures using CNNs and an ensemble classifier for improved accuracy. 
- The VGG16 model outperforms other models, but the voting classifier method is used to reduce misclassification and increase prediction confidence. 
- The system aims to bridge communication gaps between ASL users and those unfamiliar with sign language, promoting inclusivity and improving accessibility for diverse users.
